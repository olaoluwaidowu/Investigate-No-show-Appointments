# Project: Investigate No-show Appointments Dataset

## by Olaoluwa Idowu


## "No-show Appointments" dataset

> This dataset is on medical appointments in Brazil and it is focused on whether or not a patient a patient shows up for their appointment. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.


## Summary of Findings

> The adult group kept appointments more than other age groups.

> There is no significant difference between those with scholarships and those without. 
Having a scholarship for appointments may not affect a patient's decision to show up for an appointment.


## Limitations

> I cannot ascertain if giving scholarships will help patients keep to appointments without further statistical tests.

> Unavailability of statistics on age groupings in Brazil. The age grouping in the country could be different from that of Canada used in this analysis
